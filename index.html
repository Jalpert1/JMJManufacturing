                <p>
                3D printing is an additive manufacturing process that creates a three-dimensional object from a digital file by adding material layer by layer. It is used to produce a wide range of physical objects, from small prototypes to large-scale components, by depositing, joining, or solidifying materials like plastic, resin, or metal under computer control.

				    <p>JMJ is happy to announce we'll be adding metallisation to our services offered. We’re partnering with Kymera International and the Metallisation team to bring their ground breaking thermal Spray technology to the USA.</p>
				    <p>What is Metallisation? Metallization is the process of applying a thin layer of metal to a non-metallic or metallic surface to improve its properties or appearance. It is used in microchip manufacturing to create conductive pathways and in industrial applications to add protective or decorative coatings to various materials, such as plastic and steel.</p>
				    <cite>Look forward to this new service coming Q1 2026</cite>

				    <summary class="newsSummary">Happy Holidays from the JMJ Team! 10/12/2025</summary>
				    <p>With the holidays rapidly approaching, JMJ is busy as ever. Every year around this time we see a jump in orders, leading to longer production turnaround times. To help maintain the quality of our work while still giving our team time to spend with their families, we will be cutting off 2025 orders on 11/22 at 11:59pm Central Time. If you have any work you would like done with us completed before the new year, you'll need to get your order in before the cutoff date.</p>
				    <p>We know this can cause inconveniences to you, but we hope that you give our team the time they need to get your projects done to a high standard in a timely manner. </p>
				    <cite>Thanks for another great year! - JMJ Management </cite>
